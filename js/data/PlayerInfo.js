Without the luxuries modern players can utilise, the semifinalists resorted to cooling themselves with wet cabbage leaves placed inside their hats. In an era of no tiebreak sets (they would be introduced in 1971), Laver would go on to secure the match 7-5 22-20 9-11 1-6 6-3 and set up his first Grand Slam title of his calendar Slam year. ",

However,  this  was  a  precursor  for  a remarkable  nine  match  winning  streak  that  culminated  in  her  shock  victory  over  world number two and four-time Grand Slam winner Arantxa Sanchez Vicario.

Known  for  her heavily  topspun  groundstrokes, distinctive one-handed backhand and ability to serve-and-volley at will, Mauresmo would be described by Davenport as ‘playing like a guy’, spurring further jibes from final opponent Martina Hingis before the Frenchwoman became one of the only openly gay tennis players on tour at the time.",

      "The 1972 Open, marred by a crippled field due to ongoing disputes regarding the professionalisation of tennis that featured only eight non-Australian players, proved the perfect setting for ‘ Muscles’  to successfully hoist the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup - this marked his fourth Open crown and eighth and last Grand Slam title. ",
      "The Australian broadcaster has been synonymous with coverage of the Grand Slam tournament ever since tennis entered the Open Era, following the tournament’ s move to Melbourne. The partnership has been unparalleled in Australian sport, with free-to-air rights secured until at least 2019.  ",
      "The Swede secured his first of three Open titles against the then-world number one in clinical fashion, dispatching the Czechoslovakian in straight sets 6-1 6-4 6-4. Wilander would proceed to hold the honour as the only player, male or female, to win an Australian Open at both Melbourne sites - Kooyong and Melbourne Park.",
      "The buzz around Melbourne was palpable as Flinders Park and the National Tennis Centre played host to the first singles matches under lights in the Open’ s history with top seeded Czechoslovakian Ivan Lendl and second seeded American Martina Navratilova headlining the night. The pair would go on to dispatch unheralded Australian duo Bryan Roe and Liz Minter respectively in straight sets to kickstart the reinvigorated tournament.",
      "The modern world of media sport does its upmost to deny its athletes time for solitude, particularly in the aftermath of triumphs. German Boris Becker achieved just that following his maiden Open triumph over Ivan Lendl, exiting Rod Laver Arena to reflect on his win among a group of trees before returning for the trophy presentations. ",
      "In arguably the most iconic post-match celebrations in Australian Open history, mercurial American and two-time Open champion Jim Courier made a habit of taking a dip in the Yarra River following his consecutive triumphs at Melbourne Park over Swede Stefan Edberg. After being baited by his coach Brad Stine three days prior to the 1992 final, Courier would return to the murky waters with Stine for a second year, not before almost being halted by leg cramps.",

      "The Australian Open is synonymous with the extremities of mid-summer weather conditions and this was never more evident in flooding which halted the all-American men’ s semifinal between Aaron Krickstein and Andre Agassi. In spite of cabling from television and umpiring systems presenting the potential for electrocution, reigning women’ s doubles champions Natasha Zvereva and Gigi Fernandez provided light-hearted entertainment during the interval, breaking out into dance on the drenched centre court. ",
      "The backcourts of the Australian Open have played host to some memorable encounters and are some of the rawest sites of emotion in tennis. The almost doubling in size of the number of courts enabled players better access to practice courts and allowing a smoother order of play.",
      "The ‘ Can’ t-Miss-Swiss’  was the belle of the 1997 women’ s tennis season, as her maiden major title, which also crowned her as the youngest women’ s Slam champion in the Open Era, would be the first of three captured that year. The fourth seed swept past 1995 champion Mary Pierce 6-2 6-2 in the final. ",
      "A second roofed showcourt was introduced to the Melbourne Park complex at the turn of the millennium, with the multi-purpose velodrome capable of hosting tennis matches during the Open. The stadium, with capacity seating at 10,500, became open to ground pass holders in 2015 following the redevelopment of Margaret Court Arena.",
      "While the Australian Open has now enjoyed 14 consecutive years of equality since 2001, the tournament had a prior history of doling out equal prizemoney to male and female tennis players in the 80’ s and 90’ s. The tournament also holds the honour as the only Grand Slam to have ever provided women’ s players more money than their male counterparts as seen during the Open’ s 1987 and 1988 instalments. ",
      "Colloquially known as the ‘ People’ s Court,’  MCA joined Rod Laver Arena in showcasing a men’ s match during night sessions throughout the opening three rounds. The first night match would pit that year’ s finalist Marat Safin against former US collegiate player Brian Vahaly, with the enigmatic Russian prevailing 6-2 3-6 6-3 6-4. ",
      "Not one to shy away from firsts, Marat Safin etched his name further into history as not only the inaugural winner of a nighttime men’ s final at the Australian Open, but also securing this victory over perennial Australian favourite Lleyton Hewitt during the tournament’ s centennial celebrations. Safin would send the tough crowd into fits of laughter during his trophy speech after his 1-6 6-3 6-4 6-4 triumph, thanking the Australian’ s support team before his own.",
      "In a sign of the Open’ s growing shift towards Asia, Vodafone relinquished naming rights in 2008 to Chinese whitegoods company Hisense. The company recently re-signed a deal for the stadium’ s current name to remain until 2017.",

      "Arguably the greatest women’ s player to step foot on a tennis court, Williams used her successful Australian Open campaign to notch up a year in which she fell agonisingly short of completing the elusive calendar year Grand Slam. After overcoming a duo of rising stars in Elina Svitolina and Garbine Muguruza, the American triumphed over long-time rival Maria Sharapova in what was an entertaining final, 6-3 7-6(5). "

      "Named the ATP Star of Tomorrow in November 2014, Croatian Borna Coric is well on his way to becoming a household name for tennis fans at the tender age of 18. The former world number one junior recorded impressive wins over Jerzy Janowicz, Ernests Gulbis, Lukas Rosol and Rafael Nadal in 2014 to become the youngest player since Nadal himself in 2003 to break into the top 100 ATP rankings.  Coric was also the youngest player to ever beat Rafael Nadal in straight sets. Coricǯs meteoric rise appears to have no signs of slowing in 2015, receiving direct entry into a Grand Slam for the first time during the Australian Open and later defeating current world number 3 Andy Murray in the quarter finals of the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships.  Coric credits his success to movement around the court and mental toughness.",
      "After being introduced to the game at the age of 8, Pouille grew up idolising Swiss champion Roger Federer. Pouille marked himself as a potential star of the future for tennis fans, reaching the second round of the 2013 French Open on his Grand Slam debut.  His 2014 victories over 18th ranked Croatian Ivo Karlovic and 29th ranked Italian Fabio Fognini showcased his enormous potential, and his 2015 victory over 21st ranked Austrian Dominic Thiem confirmed his status as one to watch for tennis fans. ",
      "Nicknamed 'Dominator', former French Open junior finalist Dominic Thiem started playing tennis at the age of 6. After achieving his first main draw victory at a Grand Slam during the 2014 Australian Open over Portugals João Sousa, Thiem's growth continued with an impressive 4th round showing at the 2014 US Open.  Thiem's first ATP career title came at the Open de Nice Cote d'Azur in France with victory over Argentina's Leonardo Mayer in May 2015, and he has added a further two ATP titles to his resume since. A rising star of the game, his first official seeding at a Grand Slam came when seeded 32nd for the 2015 Wimbledon Championships. ",
      "A successful junior reaching the 2013 Australian and US Open boysǯ finals, Kokkinakis shot to prominence with a hard fought 4 set victory over Dutchman Igor Sijsling at the 2014 Australian Open.  A career best Grand Slam performance in reaching the 3rd round of the 2015 French Open showed tennis fans glimpses of the enormous potential of the young Australian, who successfully broke into the top 100 during 2015.
