<Hightlight_content>The inaugural Australian Open of the Open Era certainly did not disappoint with Australian legends Rod Laver and Tony Roche battling it out in 40 degree heat over the course of more than four hours. Without the luxuries modern players can utilise, the semifinalists resorted to cooling themselves with wet cabbage leaves placed inside their hats. In an era of no tiebreak sets (they would be introduced in 1971), Laver would go on to secure the match 7-5 22-20 9-11 1-6 6-3 and set up his first Grand Slam title of his calendar Slam year. </Hightlight_content>
